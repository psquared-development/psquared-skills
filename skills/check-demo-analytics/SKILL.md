# Check Demo Analytics

## STEP 0 — Check Environment

Read `.env` in the current directory and source it.

Required tokens:
- **CRM API** — `PSQUARED_CRM_TOKEN`
- **Ackee API** — `ACKEE_TOKEN`, and `ACKEE_DOMAIN` (base URL, e.g. `https://ackee.psquared.dev`)

Stop if missing.

**Ackee config:**
- API: `$ACKEE_DOMAIN/api` (GraphQL)
- Demo domain ID: `4bdddc8c-11d9-4d7e-ab94-aeb7866f0bb2`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer $ACKEE_TOKEN`

> **Once verified:** `Environment OK. Pulling analytics...`

---

## STEP 1 — Get Demo Page Views from Ackee

Query Ackee for page-level statistics on the demo domain:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$ACKEE_DOMAIN/api" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACKEE_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"query":"{ domain(id: \"4bdddc8c-11d9-4d7e-ab94-aeb7866f0bb2\") { statistics { pages(sorting: TOP, range: LAST_30_DAYS) { id value count } views(interval: DAILY, type: UNIQUE, limit: 30) { id count } } } }"}'
```

From the `pages` results, extract views per demo page. The `value` field contains the URL path (e.g., `/?id=abc123`). Map each `id` parameter to a demo.

Also get total unique views over the last 30 days from the `views` array.

---

## STEP 2 — Get Pipeline State from CRM

Query CRM for all active opportunities at SCREENING stage:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://crm.psquared.dev/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PSQUARED_CRM_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"query":"{ opportunities(filter: { stage: { eq: SCREENING } }, first: 100) { edges { node { id name demoStatus demoUrl { primaryLinkUrl } company { name } createdAt } } } }"}'
```

Also get recently converted (PROPOSAL stage):

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://crm.psquared.dev/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PSQUARED_CRM_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"query":"{ opportunities(filter: { stage: { eq: PROPOSAL } }, first: 20) { edges { node { id name company { name } createdAt } } } }"}'
```

Also get paying customers (CUSTOMER stage):

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://crm.psquared.dev/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PSQUARED_CRM_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"query":"{ opportunities(filter: { stage: { eq: CUSTOMER } }, first: 20) { edges { node { id name company { name } createdAt } } } }"}'
```

---

## STEP 3 — Cross-Reference & Analyze

For each SCREENING opportunity with a demoUrl:
1. Extract the demoId from the URL (`?id=xxx`)
2. Find matching Ackee page views (match on `/?id=xxx` path)
3. Calculate days since outreach was sent (from demoStatus timestamps)

Categorize each opportunity:

| Category | Criteria | Action needed |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Hot** | Views > 0 + demoStatus = SENT/FOLLOW_UP_SENT | Prospect is engaging — consider direct outreach |
| **Warm** | Views > 0 + not yet sent | Demo is getting organic traffic — prioritize sending |
| **Cold** | Views = 0 + SENT > 7 days ago | No engagement — follow-up or deprioritize |
| **Fresh** | SENT < 5 days ago | Too early to judge |
| **Pending** | PENDING_REVIEW or OK_TO_SEND | Still in pipeline — not yet sent |
| **Converted** | Stage = PROPOSAL | Already signed up |

---

## STEP 4 — Query Ackee Events

To get event counts, query each event:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$ACKEE_DOMAIN/api" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACKEE_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"query":"{ event(id: \"[eventId]\") { statistics { chart(interval: DAILY, type: TOTAL) { id count } list(sorting: TOP, type: TOTAL) { id value count } } } }"}'
```

**Event IDs:**
- CTA Click: Claim Bot — `0f037f1c-c2c0-4205-b90d-3cb9bf66f9c2`
- CTA Click: Discover Platform — `1911cb2c-96a9-478e-8a45-82ae8fa71bc8`
- Widget Opened — `df5c0d51-1e96-43a9-8d73-13e0e82e99b3`
- Plan Selected — `8693d36c-09a1-4b86-bf29-763e612f4843`

The `list` query with `sorting: TOP` shows which demo pages / plans got the most actions. The `key` field contains the demoId or planId.

**Email sent/failed counts:** Use `GET /stats/funnel` from the notification service instead of manually counting drafts. This endpoint returns accurate sent/failed totals per campaign.

## STEP 5 — Report

> **Announce:**
> ```

> Demo page viewed:       [N]  ([%] of sent — email→click rate)
> CTA clicked:            [N]  ([%] of viewed — interest rate)
> Signed up (PROPOSAL):   [N]  ([%] of CTA — conversion rate)

>
> HOT LEADS (views + email sent)
>   - [Company A] — [N] views, sent [N] days ago
>   - [Company B] — [N] views, sent [N] days ago
>
> COLD LEADS (no views, 7+ days)
>   - [Company C] — 0 views, sent [N] days ago
>
> RECOMMENDATIONS
>   [Based on funnel bottleneck:]
>   - If email→view rate is low: "Subject lines may need work, or emails landing in spam"
>   - If view→CTA rate is low: "Demo pages aren't converting — check offer text, countdown, widget"
>   - If CTA→signup rate is low: "Signup friction too high — check onboarding flow"
>   - If signup→paid rate is low: "Trial experience or pricing needs adjustment"
>   - Plus specific company-level recommendations
> ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
