# InboxMate Demo Setup Pipeline

> **Announce to the user at the very start:**
> ```
> ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> InboxMate Demo Pipeline started.
> Working through 6 phases — I'll narrate each step.
> ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> ```

---

## PHASE 0 — Learn the Platform

> **Announce:** `[0/5] Learning InboxMate platform capabilities...`

**You are new to InboxMate. Do this before anything else.**

InboxMate is a white-label AI chatbot platform built by psquared. Businesses embed a chat widget on their website — visitors chat with an AI agent that knows the company's products, services, and FAQs.

The MCP server at `https://app.psquared.dev/api/mcp` exposes tools to create and configure these agents programmatically. All operations run against a shared demo account.

**Call `tools/list` on the MCP server first** to get the current tool list and confirm connectivity:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"notifications/initialized","params":{}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}
```

**Environment variables** (read from `.env` in the current working directory at startup):
- `NUXT_MCP_DEMO_TOKEN` — Bearer token for the InboxMate MCP server
- `OPENBRAND_API_KEY` — API key for OpenBrand color/logo extraction (used in Phase 2f)

**MCP connection:**
- URL: `https://app.psquared.dev/api/mcp`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <NUXT_MCP_DEMO_TOKEN>`
- Transport: JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP POST

**Key concepts:**
- **Agent** — the AI chatbot entity. Has a system prompt, greeting, widget config (color, domain whitelist, predefined questions)
- **Knowledge bucket** — a vector store. Contains multiple knowledge items that the agent retrieves at query time
- **Knowledge items** — individual focused text chunks added to a bucket. Each item should cover ONE topic (overview, pricing, FAQ, contact, etc.)
- **whitelistedDomains** — controls where the widget appears. Defaults to `demo.inboxmate.psquared.dev`

> **After confirming tools list, announce:** `[0/5] Platform ready. Proceeding to prospect research.`

---

## PHASE 1 — Research the Prospect

> **Announce:** `[1/5] Researching [Company Name]...`

### 1a — Validate Website First

Before scraping, **check if the website is reachable and current**. Use `WebFetch` on the homepage.

**Auto-skip if ANY of these are true:**
- Website returns HTTP error / timeout / unreachable
- Domain is parked, expired, or "coming soon"
- Page has no meaningful content (just a logo or placeholder)
- Copyright year is 2+ years behind current year — site is abandoned
- Only a social media profile exists (no real website)

> If the website is unusable, announce: `SKIP: [Company] — [reason]. Website is not suitable for a demo.`
> **Do NOT ask the user what to do.** Just skip and move on.
> If running as part of the batch pipeline, the batch skill handles CRM marking.
> If running standalone, just stop and report the skip reason — the user can decide later.

### 1b — Scrape Content

Given a company name and/or domain, **fetch all of these pages** (adjust paths as needed):

| Page | What to extract |
|------|-----------------|
| Homepage | Core value prop, headline, tagline, main CTA |
| /about or /ueber-uns | Company story, team, mission, founding year |
| /products or /services or /leistungen | All products/services with descriptions, features, differentiators |
| /pricing or /preise | Pricing tiers, what's included, trial info |
| /faq | Common questions and answers verbatim |
| /contact or /kontakt | Email, phone, address, business hours, contact form |
| /blog or /cases (optional) | Social proof, use cases, customer stories |

**Use WebFetch on each URL.** Do not skip pages — thin knowledge = bad demo.

**Extract and record:**
- Company name (exact spelling, including GmbH/AG/Ltd if present)
- Core product/service in one sentence
- Target customer segment
- Top 3 USPs (what makes them different)
- Pricing structure (free trial? subscription? one-time?)
- Primary CTA (book demo / sign up / contact / request quote)
- Contact details (email, phone, address, hours)
- Tone of the website (formal/informal, corporate/friendly)
- **Primary language** of the website content

> **After fetching, announce:** `[1/5] Research complete. Analyzing language and planning content...`

---

## PHASE 2 — Language Detection & Content Planning

> **Announce:** `[2/5] Planning agent content and language configuration...`

### 2a — Detect Language

Look at the website content you scraped:

| Signal | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| Website is in German only | `language: 'de'` |
| Website is in English only | `language: 'en'` |
| Website has both DE and EN, or company serves both markets | `language: 'multi'` |
| Austrian/German/Swiss company with DE site but international product | `language: 'multi'` |
| English-only company, no German signals | `language: 'en'` |

> **Announce your decision:** `Language: [EN / DE / MULTI] — [reason in one sentence]`

### 2b — Plan Knowledge Items

**Do NOT put all content into one blob.** Create separate focused knowledge items per topic. Each item is independently retrieved by vector search — short, specific items win over large walls of text.

Plan these items (create all that have content):

| Item | Title | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `[Company] – Überblick` / `[Company] – Overview` | What the company does, who they serve, core value prop, founding story |
| 2 | `Produkte & Leistungen` / `Products & Services` | All services/products with descriptions, key features, use cases |
| 3 | `Preise & Pakete` / `Pricing & Plans` | All pricing tiers, what's included, trial/free tier info, upgrade path |
| 4 | `Häufige Fragen` / `FAQ` | All Q&A pairs from the FAQ page verbatim |
| 5 | `Kontakt & Support` / `Contact & Support` | Email, phone, address, hours, how to reach support, response time |
| 6 | `Anwendungsfälle` / `Use Cases` | Customer stories, case studies, example use cases, industries served |
| 7 (multi-lang only) | `Sprachunterstützung & KI-Features` / `Language Support & AI Features` | Explain that the assistant supports both German and English. List key InboxMate features relevant to THIS company (24/7 availability, instant answers, website integration). Frame as benefits for this company's customers. |

> Write all item content in the **target language(s)**. For `multi`: write each item in the language that's most natural for that content, or bilingual if the company operates in both.

### 2c — Craft the System Prompt

Write a **crisp, specific system prompt** — not a generic template. Include ALL of these:

```
You are [Persona Name], the AI assistant for [Company Name].

**Who you help:** [Target customer segment in 1 sentence]

**Your personality and tone:** [Derived from website tone — e.g. "friendly and approachable, using informal language (du/you)" OR "professional and precise, using formal language (Sie/formal English)"]

**Language:** [e.g. "Always respond in German (du-Form)" OR "Respond in the language the visitor uses — German or English"]

**Your goal:** Help visitors understand [Company]'s [main product/service] and guide them toward [primary CTA — e.g. "booking a free demo", "starting a free trial", "contacting the sales team"].

**What you know:** You have access to [Company]'s complete product information, pricing, FAQ, and contact details. Answer from this knowledge.

**When you can't answer:** If a question falls outside your knowledge, say so honestly and offer to connect them with the team: [contact email or "via the contact form on [domain]"].

**Never:** Invent pricing, make promises not reflected in company materials, or discuss competitors in detail.
```

Adjust heavily based on actual company context. This prompt should sound like it was written for THIS specific company.

### 2d — Greeting Message

Write in target language. **Not generic.** Reference the product, their situation, or a hook.

- **Bad:** "Hi! How can I help you?"
- **Good (EN):** "Hi! I'm [Name], [Company]'s AI assistant. Ask me anything about our [product] — pricing, features, or how to get started."
- **Good (DE):** "Hallo! Ich bin [Name], der KI-Assistent von [Company]. Stell mir gerne Fragen zu unseren [Dienstleistungen] — ich helfe dir weiter!"

For `multi`: write separate EN and DE greetings.

### 2e — Predefined Quick Questions (Card Tiles)

**ALWAYS use card tiles** — never plain text pills. Cards look dramatically better and convert higher. They show an icon, a bold title, and a short description — making suggestions feel like real features instead of generic prompts.

**4–5 suggestion cards** that a real prospect would click. Make them irresistible — they should surface the company's best selling points.

Each question is an object with these fields:
- **`text`**: The actual message sent to the chat when clicked. This is what the AI will answer.
- **`title`**: Short card title displayed prominently (2-5 words). This is what the user reads first.
- **`description`**: Brief hint about what to expect (3-5 words). Shown below the title in smaller text.
- **`icon`**: A Lucide icon name in **kebab-case** (e.g. `"briefcase"`, `"credit-card"`, `"shield-check"`, `"clock"`, `"users"`, `"rocket"`, `"globe"`, `"zap"`, `"heart"`, `"target"`, `"lightbulb"`, `"star"`, `"package"`, `"award"`, `"calendar"`, `"mail"`, `"phone"`, `"building"`, `"trending-up"`, `"search"`). If invalid, falls back to a checkmark.

Rules:
- Use the target language (both EN + DE arrays for `multi`)
- Mix types: feature question, pricing question, differentiator question, use-case question
- Keep titles short (2-5 words), descriptions short (3-5 words)
- The `text` field can be longer — it's the actual question the AI answers
- Always set `style: 'cards'` in the `update_quick_questions` call

**Examples for a SaaS company:**
```json
// EN
[
  { "text": "What does [Product] do and who is it for?", "title": "What is [Product]?", "description": "Features & use cases", "icon": "rocket" },
  { "text": "How much does [Product] cost? Are there different plans?", "title": "Pricing & Plans", "description": "Tiers & free trial", "icon": "credit-card" },
  { "text": "How long does setup take and do I need technical knowledge?", "title": "Getting Started", "description": "Setup in minutes", "icon": "zap" },
  { "text": "What makes [Product] different from competitors?", "title": "Why [Company]?", "description": "Key differentiators", "icon": "award" }
]
// DE
[
  { "text": "Was macht [Produkt] und für wen ist es gedacht?", "title": "Was ist [Produkt]?", "description": "Funktionen & Einsatz", "icon": "rocket" },
  { "text": "Was kostet [Produkt]? Gibt es verschiedene Pakete?", "title": "Preise & Pakete", "description": "Tarife & Testphase", "icon": "credit-card" },
  { "text": "Wie lange dauert die Einrichtung und brauche ich technisches Wissen?", "title": "Erste Schritte", "description": "Setup in Minuten", "icon": "zap" },
  { "text": "Was unterscheidet [Produkt] von der Konkurrenz?", "title": "Warum [Company]?", "description": "Die Vorteile", "icon": "award" }
]
```

### 2f — Brand Color (via OpenBrand API)

Use the **OpenBrand API** to extract the brand color — it's more reliable than manual CSS inspection.

**API call:**
```bash
curl "https://openbrand.sh/api/extract?url=https://[domain]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENBRAND_API_KEY"
```

The `OPENBRAND_API_KEY` is in the `.env` file (read it at startup along with the other tokens).

**Response format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "brandName": "Company Name",
    "logos": [{ "url": "...", "type": "favicon", "resolution": {...} }],
    "colors": [
      { "hex": "#3b82f6", "usage": "primary" },
      { "hex": "#64748b", "usage": "secondary" },
      { "hex": "#ffffff", "usage": "accent" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**How to pick the color:**
1. Use the color with `"usage": "primary"` from the response
2. **NEVER use pure black (`#000000`) or pure white (`#ffffff`)** as the widget color — even if it's the brand's primary. These look broken in the widget. If the primary is black or white, use the `secondary` color instead.
3. If the primary color is too light (very pale pastel) or too dark (near-black), use the next best color from the response
4. If OpenBrand returns an error or no colors, fall back to manual extraction from CSS/HTML
5. If the primary color looks washed out for a widget accent, prefer the darkest non-white, non-black color returned

> **Also grab the logo URL** from `data.logos` — use the highest-resolution one as `logoUrl` in the demo page.

If OpenBrand fails, fall back to manual inspection:
1. Check the primary button/CTA color in HTML/CSS
2. Look at logo colors and dominant accent
3. Pick the darkest shade if multiple variants exist
4. Use hex format (e.g. `#1a365d`)

### 2g — Demo Page Content

#### Offer deadline — ASK THE USER

**Before setting the offer, ask the user for the deadline.** Do NOT assume 7 days or any other duration.

> **Ask:**
> ```
> When should the demo offer expire?
> Examples: "in 14 days", "2026-04-01", "end of month"
> ```

Wait for the user's answer. Convert their response to an ISO 8601 date for `offerExpiresAt`.

**If running as part of `/inboxmate-batch-demo`:** Ask ONCE at the start for all demos in the batch (e.g., "All demos expire on 2026-04-15"). Do NOT ask per company.

#### Offer text — STRICT RULES

- **offerText**: The headline shown above the countdown timer. It describes the **limited-time offer** the prospect gets if they sign up before the deadline.

**FORBIDDEN — never use any of these:**
- ~~"Kostenlose Erstberatung"~~ (free consultation)
- ~~"Kostenlose Beratung"~~ (free consultation)
- ~~"Kostenloses Erstgespräch"~~ (free initial call)
- Any variation of "free consultation/call/meeting" — **we are NOT offering consultations**

**What the offer IS:** A time-limited discount or special deal for signing up to InboxMate (the chatbot product). The countdown shows when this deal expires.

**Use one of these patterns:**
- DE: `"Jetzt starten und 50% Rabatt sichern"` / `"Sonderkonditionen für Ihren KI-Chatbot — nur bis [date]"` / `"Ihren KI-Assistenten jetzt aktivieren — exklusive Konditionen"`
- EN: `"Start now and save 50% in your first year"` / `"Special pricing for your AI chatbot — limited time"` / `"Activate your AI assistant — exclusive terms available"`

- **customMessage**: 1–2 sentences speaking directly to the prospect: "Wir haben diesen Demo-Bot speziell für [Company] konfiguriert. Probier ihn aus!"

> **After planning, show a summary to the user:**
> ```
> ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> PLAN READY — confirm before building:
>   Company: [name]
>   Language: [en/de/multi]
>   Knowledge items: [N items listed by title]
>   Quick questions: [list]
>   Color: [hex]
>   Offer: [offerText]
>   Deadline: [offerExpiresAt]
> Proceeding to build in 5 seconds unless you say stop.
> ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> ```

---

## PHASE 3 — Build the Agent via MCP

> **Announce:** `[3/5] Building agent in InboxMate...`

Use **individual MCP tools** — do NOT use `quick_setup_demo` for the full pipeline. It only supports one knowledge item. We need multiple.

### Step 3.1 — Create Agent

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "create_agent",
    "arguments": {
      "name": "[Company] Assistant",
      "prompt": "[full system prompt from 2c]",
      "primaryColor": "[hex from 2f]",
      "greetingMessage": "[EN greeting from 2d — omit if DE-only]",
      "greetingMessageDe": "[DE greeting from 2d — omit if EN-only]",
      "buttonIcon": "[choose based on company personality — see guide below]",
      "buttonShape": "[circle, squared, or icon-only — see guide below]",
      "agentIconType": "[choose based on company personality — see guide below]",
      "widgetPresence": "[shimmer or calm — see guide below]",
      "uiLang": "[en, de, or multi — must match language from Phase 2]"
    }
  }
}
```

**Widget appearance guide — ALWAYS set these fields:**

| Field | How to choose |
|-------|--------------|
| `buttonIcon` | The floating button visitors click to open chat. Match the company vibe: `messageCircle` (friendly default), `sparkles` (creative/modern), `chat` (support-focused), `help` (FAQ-heavy), `inboxmate` (InboxMate branding), `heart` (warm/personal), `zap` (tech/fast), `globe` (international). Do NOT default to `robot`. |
| `agentIconType` | The avatar shown next to AI messages in the chat. Options: `inboxmate` (branded, good default), `avatar` (human-like, good for personal brands), `bot` (techy). Pick one that DIFFERS from `buttonIcon`. |
| `buttonShape` | `circle` = round floating button (default, works everywhere). `squared` = rounded square (modern/minimal). `icon-only` = just the icon, no background (sleek/subtle). |
| `widgetPresence` | `calm` = no animations, professional (corporate/B2B sites). `shimmer` = subtle glow effects (modern/creative brands). Default to `calm` for most business sites. |

**Rules:**
- `buttonIcon` and `agentIconType` MUST be different from each other
- Never default to `robot` — choose based on the company's personality and industry
- When in doubt: `buttonIcon: "messageCircle"`, `agentIconType: "inboxmate"`, `buttonShape: "circle"`, `widgetPresence: "calm"`

> Save `agentId` from the response. **Announce:** `Agent created: [agentId]`

### Step 3.2 — Create Knowledge Bucket

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "create_knowledge_bucket",
    "arguments": {
      "name": "[Company] Knowledge",
      "description": "Website knowledge base for [Company] — [N] items"
    }
  }
}
```

> Save `bucketId`. **Announce:** `Knowledge bucket created: [bucketId]`

### Step 3.3 — Add Knowledge Items

For **each item planned in 2b**, call `add_to_bucket` separately.

**CRITICAL: Always include `sourceUrl`.** This enables source citations in the chatbot — the wow effect for prospects. The URL must point to the actual page the content was scraped from (e.g. `https://company.at/leistungen` for the services item, `https://company.at/kontakt` for the contact item). If content came from the homepage, use the homepage URL. **Never omit sourceUrl.**

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "add_to_bucket",
    "arguments": {
      "bucketId": "[bucketId]",
      "title": "[item title]",
      "content": "[item content — focused, complete, in target language]",
      "sourceUrl": "https://[domain]/[exact page path this content came from]"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Announce after each:** `Knowledge item added: "[title]" (source: [url])`
>
> Wait for each call to complete before the next — do NOT batch these.

### Step 3.3b — (If multi-lang) Add Language Support item

If language is `multi`: add one extra knowledge item to the bucket:

- **Title:** `"Sprachunterstützung / Language Support"`
- **Content:**
  ```
  This AI assistant supports both German and English. It responds in whatever language the visitor uses.

  Key features relevant for [Company]:
  - Available 24/7, responds instantly in German or English
  - Trained on [Company]'s complete product and service information
  - Handles common customer questions so your team doesn't have to
  - Guides visitors toward [primary CTA]
  - Escalates to your team for complex inquiries

  Use cases for [Company]:
  [Write 2-3 specific use cases based on what you know about the company]
  ```

**Content quality rules:**
- Each item: 200–800 words. Long enough to be useful, short enough for precise retrieval.
- Write in complete sentences, not bullet-point dumps
- Include actual numbers, prices, and specifics from the website
- For FAQ items: include both the question AND the answer, verbatim if possible

### Step 3.4 — Link Bucket to Agent

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "set_knowledge",
    "arguments": {
      "agentId": "[agentId]",
      "knowledgeBucketIds": ["[bucketId]"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3.5 — Set Quick Questions (Card Format)

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "update_quick_questions",
    "arguments": {
      "agentId": "[agentId]",
      "style": "cards",
      "questionsEn": [
        { "text": "[message sent to chat]", "title": "[Card Title]", "description": "[3-5 word hint]", "icon": "[lucide-icon-name]" },
        { "text": "[message sent to chat]", "title": "[Card Title]", "description": "[3-5 word hint]", "icon": "[lucide-icon-name]" }
      ],
      "questionsDe": [
        { "text": "[Nachricht an den Chat]", "title": "[Karten-Titel]", "description": "[3-5 Wort Hinweis]", "icon": "[lucide-icon-name]" },
        { "text": "[Nachricht an den Chat]", "title": "[Karten-Titel]", "description": "[3-5 Wort Hinweis]", "icon": "[lucide-icon-name]" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> For EN-only: use `questionsEn` only, leave `questionsDe` as `[]`.
> For DE-only: use `questionsDe` only, leave `questionsEn` as `[]`.
> Always set `style: "cards"` — this enables the rich card display in the widget.

### Step 3.5b — Restrict widget to demo page only

After the demo page is created (Phase 4), the MCP automatically calls `update_widget_style`
to set `showOnPages: ['/?id=<demoId>']`. This is handled by the `create_demo_page` tool.
You do NOT need to call `update_widget_style` manually for this.

### Step 3.6 — Publish Agent

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "publish_agent",
    "arguments": { "agentId": "[agentId]" }
  }
}
```

> **Announce:** `Agent published and live.`

---

## PHASE 4 — Create Demo Page

> **Announce:** `[4/5] Creating demo page...`

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "create_demo_page",
    "arguments": {
      "agentId": "[agentId]",
      "companyName": "[Company Name]",
      "companyDomain": "[domain.com]",
      "logoUrl": "[logo URL if found — otherwise omit]",
      "offerText": "[from 2g]",
      "offerExpiresAt": "[ISO date 7 days from today]",
      "customMessage": "[from 2g]",
      "language": "[en or de — must match the language you chose in Phase 2]",
      "useCases": [
        { "text": "[Use case 1 — specific to this company, 1 sentence]", "icon": "[lucide-icon-name]" },
        { "text": "[Use case 2 — specific to this company, 1 sentence]", "icon": "[lucide-icon-name]" },
        { "text": "[Use case 3 — specific to this company, 1 sentence]", "icon": "[lucide-icon-name]" },
        { "text": "[Use case 4 — optional, if relevant]", "icon": "[lucide-icon-name]" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> The MCP will automatically restrict the widget to only show on `/?id=<demoId>` — no extra step needed.

> Save `demoId` and `playgroundUrl`.

---

## PHASE 5 — Create Opportunity in CRM

> **Announce:** `[5/6] Creating CRM opportunity...`

Create an opportunity in the CRM so the demo enters the review pipeline:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://crm.psquared.dev/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PSQUARED_CRM_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"query\":\"mutation { createOpportunity(data: { name: \\\"[Company Name] — InboxMate Demo\\\", stage: SCREENING, demoStatus: PENDING_REVIEW, demoUrl: { primaryLinkUrl: \\\"[playgroundUrl]\\\" }, companyId: \\\"[companyId]\\\" }) { id name stage demoStatus } }\"}"
```

> **Note:** The `companyId` comes from the CRM. If this company doesn't exist in the CRM yet (standalone demo, not from batch pipeline), look it up first or create it.

> **Announce:** `Opportunity created at SCREENING / PENDING_REVIEW — ready for /review-demos`

---

## PHASE 6 — Deliver

> **Announce:** `[6/6] Done!`

Output this summary to the user:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DEMO READY — [Company Name]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Playground URL (share this with the prospect):
→ [playgroundUrl]

What was configured:
  Language:        [en / de / multi]
  Brand color:     [hex]
  System prompt:   [first 2 sentences of the prompt]
  Greeting (EN):   [greeting]
  Greeting (DE):   [greeting or "—"]
  Quick questions: [list, language-appropriate]
  Knowledge items: [N items — list titles]
  Offer:           [offerText] (expires [date])

Agent ID: [agentId] (for follow-up adjustments)
Demo ID:  [demoId]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## Follow-Up Adjustments

If the demo needs changes after delivery, use these individual tools:

| What to change | Tool |
|----------------|------|
| System prompt | `update_prompt` |
| Quick questions | `update_quick_questions` (card objects with text/title/description/icon, set `style: "cards"`) |
| Color, greeting, domain whitelist | `update_widget_style` |
| Add more knowledge | `add_to_bucket` with the existing `bucketId` |
| Republish after changes | `publish_agent` |

---

## Quality Gate — Before Delivering

Run through this checklist mentally before Phase 5:

- [ ] System prompt is specific to this company — no generic filler
- [ ] Greeting message references the product or company name
- [ ] Quick questions use card format (objects with text, title, description, icon) — NOT plain strings
- [ ] Quick questions would make a real prospect click them
- [ ] Primary color matches the company brand — NOT pure black (`#000000`) or pure white (`#ffffff`)
- [ ] At least 4 knowledge items covering: overview, services, pricing/FAQ, contact
- [ ] **Every knowledge item has a `sourceUrl`** — the exact page URL it was scraped from (enables source citations in chat)
- [ ] If multi-lang: DE and EN questions both filled, greeting in both languages
- [ ] If multi-lang: knowledge item 7 (language support + use cases) added
- [ ] Knowledge items are focused topics, not one big dump
- [ ] Offer text is about InboxMate pricing/discount — NOT "Kostenlose Beratung/Erstberatung/Erstgespräch"
- [ ] `buttonIcon` is set and matches company personality — NOT defaulting to `robot`
- [ ] `agentIconType` is set and DIFFERS from `buttonIcon`
- [ ] `buttonShape` and `widgetPresence` are set
- [ ] Widget domain is restricted to `demo.inboxmate.psquared.dev` (auto-set by the platform)
- [ ] `language` matches the company's website language
- [ ] 3-4 specific `useCases` as objects with `{ text, icon }` — not plain strings
- [ ] Use case icons are valid Lucide kebab-case names (e.g. "clock", "users", "shield-check")
- [ ] Offer deadline was confirmed by the user (not randomly picked)
- [ ] Offer text does NOT contain "Beratung", "Erstberatung", "Erstgespräch", or any consultation language
- [ ] Widget domain + page restriction set (auto-handled by `create_demo_page`)
