## Context — What This Skill Does

The notification service at `notifications.psquared.dev` stores email drafts that are reviewed before sending. Admins can attach "change requests" to drafts (e.g., "make this per du", "shorten the intro", "add a line about their pricing page"). This skill picks up those change requests, reads each draft's current HTML, applies the changes, and saves the updated version.

**The drafts are InboxMate outreach emails** — personalized cold emails sent to Austrian/German businesses to show them an AI chatbot demo we built for their company. Each email has:
- InboxMate branding (green header, p² footer)
- Personalized body text (greeting, intro, hook, CTA, highlight box, closing)
- A "Demo ansehen" button linking to their personalized demo page
- All text is controlled via Handlebars variables rendered into HTML

**Important:** The email HTML is the final rendered output. When you edit it, you're editing raw HTML — preserve all styling, tags, and structure. Only change the text content as requested.

## STEP 0 — Check Environment

**Read `.env` using the Read tool** (do NOT `source` it). Extract:
- **`EMAIL_DRAFT_ONLY_BEARER`** — bearer token for the notification service draft API

The notification service base URL is `https://notifications.psquared.dev`.

> **Once verified:** `Environment OK. Finding drafts with change requests...`

---

## STEP 1 — Find Drafts with Change Requests

Query the notification service API for DRAFT-status emails with change requests:

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://notifications.psquared.dev/drafts?status=DRAFT&hasChangeRequest=true&pageSize=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EMAIL_DRAFT_ONLY_BEARER"
```

This returns `{ success: true, data: { data: [...], total: N } }`. Each draft object contains:
- `id` — draft UUID
- `subject` — email subject
- `html_body` — full rendered HTML
- `text_body` — plain text version
- `change_request` — the requested change (string)
- `recipient_email` — recipient
- `crm_company_name` — company name
- `locale` — de or en

If none found (empty array or total=0), announce "No drafts with change requests" and stop.

> **Announce:**
> ```
> Found [N] drafts with change requests:
> 1. [Company] — "[change request]"
> 2. [Company] — "[change request]"
> ```

## STEP 2 — Apply Changes to Each Draft

For each draft with a change request:

### 2a — Read the current HTML

The `html_body` contains the full rendered email. Parse it to understand the current text content. The structure is:
- `{{greeting}}` → first `<p>` after the header divider
- `{{bodyParagraph1}}` → second `<p>`
- `{{bodyParagraph2}}` → third `<p>` (optional)
- `{{bodyParagraph3}}` → fourth `<p>` (optional)
- Button text → inside the `<a>` with `background-color:#10b981`
- Highlight title → bold `<p>` inside the green `#ecfdf5` div (optional)
- Highlight text → second `<p>` in the green div
- Closing text → `<p>` after the green div
- Signoff → `<p>` with `color:#10b981` and `font-style:italic`

### 2b — Apply the change request

Read the `change_request` text and apply it. Common requests:
- **"per du" / "use du-Form"** → Change all Sie/Ihr/Ihnen/Ihren to du/dein/dir/deinen. Change formal greetings ("Guten Tag Herr...") to informal ("Hallo [Vorname],"). Make sure EVERY sentence is consistent.
- **"per Sie" / "use Sie-Form"** → Opposite of above.
- **"shorten"** → Reduce paragraph count or length while keeping the core message.
- **"more personal"** → Add more company-specific references, make it less template-y.
- **"change subject to X"** → Update the subject field.
- **Custom instructions** → Follow them literally.

### 2c — Verify consistency

After making changes:
- If the change was about du/Sie: re-read every sentence and verify tone is consistent
- If the change was about content: verify the demo URL, company name, and button still work
- Never break the HTML structure or remove styling

### 2d — Save the updated draft

Update the draft via the notification service API:

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "https://notifications.psquared.dev/drafts/[draftId]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EMAIL_DRAFT_ONLY_BEARER" \
  -d '{"html_body": "[updated HTML]", "change_request": null}'
```

**Important:** Set `change_request` to `null` after applying — this marks it as processed.

If the change request also affects the subject:
```bash
curl -s -X PUT "https://notifications.psquared.dev/drafts/[draftId]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EMAIL_DRAFT_ONLY_BEARER" \
  -d '{"html_body": "[updated HTML]", "subject": "[new subject]", "change_request": null}'
```

> **Announce after each:** `Refined: [Company] — applied "[change request]"`

---

## STEP 3 — Report

> **Announce:**
> ```
> ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> Email Draft Refinement complete.
>
> Refined: [N]
>   - [Company A] — "per du" applied
>   - [Company B] — "shorten intro" applied
>
> Next step: Review refined drafts at
