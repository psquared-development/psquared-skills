# InboxMate Batch Demo Pipeline

## Prerequisites — Environment Variables

All required tokens are in the **`.env` file in the current working directory** (the agenthub repo root). Read it at startup to get:

- `PSQUARED_CRM_TOKEN` — Bearer token for Twenty CRM GraphQL API
- `NUXT_MCP_DEMO_TOKEN` — Bearer token for the InboxMate MCP server

**Do this first:** Read `.env` from the current directory and extract these values. If either is missing, stop and ask the user.

## Step 1 — Get Prospects from CRM

Read `PSQUARED_CRM_TOKEN` from `.env` and use it to query the Twenty CRM (GraphQL at `https://crm.psquared.dev/graphql`) for companies that do NOT yet have an opportunity. Use this approach:

1. Fetch all companies (up to 100)
2. Fetch all opportunities (up to 200)
3. Filter out companies that already have ANY opportunity (regardless of stage)

The remaining companies are unprocessed prospects.

> **Announce:** `Found [N] unprocessed prospects.`

If there's a specific company or list the user wants to process, use that instead.

---

## Step 2 — Validate Each Prospect's Website

For each prospect, **before running the demo pipeline**:

### 2a — Check if the website is reachable

Use `WebFetch` on the company's domain (from CRM `domainName.primaryLinkUrl`).

**Skip the prospect if ANY of these are true:**
- Domain returns HTTP error (4xx, 5xx) or times out
- Domain redirects to a parked/expired domain page
- Domain shows a "coming soon" or "under construction" placeholder
- Website has no meaningful content (just a logo and "contact us")
- Website is clearly outdated — copyright year 2+ years old, broken images, obviously abandoned
- Website is a social media profile only (LinkedIn, Facebook) — not a real business site

### 2b — Mark skipped prospects in CRM

**Do NOT ask the user what to do.** Auto-skip and mark in CRM immediately.

First, check if the Company object has a field like `idealCustomerProfile` (ICP) or a rating/status field you can use. Run this introspection query once at the start:

```graphql
query { __type(name: "Company") { fields { name type { name kind ofType { name } } } } }
```

**If there's a usable boolean/enum field** (e.g. `idealCustomerProfile`): set it to `false` or the "not a fit" value to mark the company directly.

**Regardless**, also create a DISQUALIFIED opportunity so the company is excluded from future batch runs:

```graphql
mutation CreateOpportunity($data: OpportunityCreateInput!) {
  createOpportunity(data: $data) { id name stage }
}
```

Variables:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "[Company] — Website not suitable",
    "stage": "DISQUALIFIED",
    "companyId": "[companyId]"
  }
}
```

Then add a note with the reason:
```graphql
mutation CreateNote($data: NoteCreateInput!) {
  createNote(data: $data) { id }
}
```
Title: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Website skipped: [reason — e.g. "unreachable", "parked domain", "outdated (copyright 2019)", "placeholder page", "no meaningful content"]`

Link the note to the opportunity.

> **Announce for each skip:** `SKIP: [Company] — [reason]`
> **Never pause to ask.** Just mark and move to the next prospect.

### 2c — Collect valid prospects

Prospects with a working, current website proceed to Step 3.

> **Announce:** `[N] prospects ready for demo creation, [M] skipped.`

---

## Step 3 — Create Demos for Valid Prospects

For each valid prospect, invoke the `/inboxmate-demo` skill (or follow the inboxmate-demo SKILL.md pipeline).

Process **one prospect at a time** — do not parallelize MCP calls.

After each demo is created:
1. The inboxmate-demo pipeline already creates an opportunity in CRM with the demo URL
2. Announce the result

> **Announce after each:**
> ```
> DONE: [Company] — [playgroundUrl]
> ```

---

## Step 4 — Summary

After all prospects are processed:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
BATCH COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Demos created: [N]
  - [Company 1] → [url]
  - [Company 2] → [url]

Skipped (website issues): [M]
  - [Company A] — [reason]
  - [Company B] — [reason]

Already processed (had opportunity): [K]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Skip Criteria Quick Reference

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| HTTP error / timeout | SKIP — "unreachable" |
| Parked / expired domain | SKIP — "parked domain" |
| "Coming soon" / "Under construction" | SKIP — "placeholder page" |
| No real content (just logo + contact form) | SKIP — "no meaningful content" |
| Copyright year 2+ years behind current | SKIP — "outdated (copyright YYYY)" |
| Broken images, dead links, 90s design | SKIP — "outdated/abandoned" |
| Social media profile only | SKIP — "no website (social only)" |
| No domain in CRM | SKIP — "no domain on file" |
